TODO.TXT for PowerShell
===============================

A simple PowerShell module for managing your todo.txt file.

The goal of this project is to provide a version of the [todo.txt CLI](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli) for Windows PowerShell. 
Sub-goals include:

1. Providing full compatibility between todo.txt files managed this project and by the original todo.txt CLI and the Android and iOS versions. Users should be able to move seamlessly between either version.
2. Providing (as closely as possible) the same command interface so that users of both versions can switch back and forth easily. 
3. Allowing PowerShell users to take advantage of PowerShell's affinity for .NET objects.
